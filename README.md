# 10 Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker


## Description

Turbo Logo Maker allows a user to generate a logo by using a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user for a shape, shape color, text, text color, and font family. Once the user selects their preferences, they are notified that their logo was saved as an SVG file.

## Tasks 

- Used the file system and inquirer package to prompt the user for their logo preferences
- Created various shapes classes that the user can select from.
- Created tests for each of the four shapes that run in jest.
- Created a video that describes the app. See Usage for more info.
